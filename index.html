        <section id="about-me">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Navigating through the exhilarating realms of both watersports and wintersports with passion and skill, motivation and efficiency are the cornerstones of my character. This affinity for physical activity isn’t just about the thrill of sports; it deeply intertwines with my professional life, where the greatest fulfillment comes from being embraced by nature. The diversity of tasks and changing environments doesn’t just energize me—it fuels my drive to push beyond my limits and achieve remarkable feats.</p>
            <p>My love for varied activities reflects a dynamic nature and a refusal to be confined to a monotonous routine. This thirst for variety and challenge manifests in both my hobbies and work ethic, finding joy and fulfillment in the outdoors. The vast, open spaces offer not just a backdrop but a canvas for endless pursuit of personal and professional growth. However, acknowledging vulnerabilities is part of the journey; getting overwhelmed at times requires taking a pause to reconnect with myself and regain focus. Handling too many tasks simultaneously presents a struggle, as does the challenge of remaining stationary for extended periods. Yet, these are not definitions of weakness but hurdles on the path of growth and evolution, a path I navigate with determination and resilience.</p>

                    <p>Event set up and service</p>
                    <p>Worked as a clerk and room waiter. We mainly worked in the event sector. We were participating in the setup and the service. This allowed me to get a first glimpse of the hotel industry.</p>

                    <p>In this post, I was in charge of setting up the bar, selling and making cocktails, and cooking finger-food like popcorn and hot dogs. I had to organize my time efficiently in order to meet the expectations of a fast and efficient service.</p>

                    <p>During my military service, I was in charge of the logistics of the post office for all the barracks in the city of Graz. This position was self-contained consisting of a series of tasks to be performed including the collection and delivery of mail and parcels as well as unforeseen tasks including that of driver. So I put in place task planning, and effective car maintenance management including the application of practical solutions.</p>

                    <p>Bartender, Runner, and Room Service</p>
                    <p>During this internship, I had a quite diverse working atmosphere, as I was taking care of room service, restaurant runner, bar, inventory, and breakfast. I was given a lot of freedom to conduct a good service and maintain a clean working space. This demanded good organization and in some cases creativity, as sometimes supplies were short due to the size of the hotel.</p>

                    <p>During my administrative internship, I have had the chance to manage the restaurant and the hotel overall. Furthermore, it gave me the opportunity to improve my management skills as I had a team of about 15 staff to manage. Sometimes, it was crucial to make fast decisions by carefully considering the outcomes. Considering the general management, I was sometimes responsible for the whole hotel when the other managers were not here or on holiday.</p>
